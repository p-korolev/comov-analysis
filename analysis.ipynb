    "# An Informal Analysis on Intra-sector Comovement\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview and Terminology\n",
    "In this brief analysis, the aim is to pick up some sort of intuition on price divergence between same sector equities. Particularly, we will analyze the *comovement* between a sector leader $L$ and a sector follower $F$. In this case, $L$ and $F$ are simply two equities that belong to some market sector $M$. As seen in the **README** file, we can conceptualize a market sector $M$ as a collection of unique equities $E_1, E_2, ..., E_n$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{MarketCap}(E_i) \\neq \\text{MarketCap}(E_j) \\text{ for all } i, j \\leq n \\text{ with } i \\neq j\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $M \\sub W$ where $W$ is an entire market. For example, Take the Energy sector of the American market. We can denote this sector as our sector $M \\sub W:=\\text{American Market}$. In a similar way, we can write an equity $E \\in M$ if the respective company of $E$ serves the sector $M$. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic Results\n",
    "From our assumption on the $\\text{MarketCap}$ of assets $E_i \\in M$, we can know that there exists some $E_l, E_f \\in M$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{(1) } E_l = \\arg\\max_{E \\in M} \\text{MarketCap}(E) \\newline\n",
    "\n",
    "\\text{(2) } E_f = \\arg\\min_{E \\in M} \\text{MarketCap}(E)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When trying to identify sector leaders, it is not generally the case that we choose the equity with the highest market cap in $M$. Typically, a sector will have numerous leaders $L_1, ..., L_k \\in M$, where each of $L_i$'s market cap is greater than the average market cap for an equity in that sector. For the rest of the notebook, we write $w(e)$ or $w_e$ as the market cap of equity $e$. Then we have,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "w(L_m) > \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w(E_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    ", for all $m \\leq k$ and $E \\in M$. These *leader* equities are like sector representatives; if the performance of the overall sector $M$ is unknown, we can look at the performance the $k$ largest companies belonging to $M$. Although not completely accurate, it would give us a good enough guess on the state of the sector. To formalize the intuition here, we know that the return (performance) of a sector $M:=\\set{E_1,...,E_n}$ can be written in terms of a market cap weighted averages:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "R_M(t) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w(E_i)R_{E_i}(t)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w(E_i)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking the difference between the general sector return and that of only the top $k$ companies ($k$ largest market caps), we get an error term $\\epsilon$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon(t) = R_M(t) - \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{k}w(E_i)R_{E_i}(t)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{k}w(E_i)} = \\frac{\\sum_{i=k+1}^{n}w(E_i)R_{E_i}(t)}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}w(E_i)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the sum of the market caps past the top $k$ equities is much smaller than the sum of market caps of all equities, $\\epsilon$ is almost negligible. From here, we can assume that the returns of the top $k$ companies in sector $M$ represent the overall sector performance almost perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Leader-Follower Comovement\n",
    "\n",
    "For a market sector $M=\\set{E_i}$, choose a representative $L$ from a list of potential sector representatives. Likewise, we can choose a sector follower $F \\in M$, to be any other equity such that its market cap, $w_F$, is less than that of the average market cap of the sector, $\\mu(w_M)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From earlier, we know that any sector leader has a larger market cap than the sector average. One way to determine a clear sector leader is to choose $L$ such that: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L \\in \\set{E_l | w(E_i)>\\mu(w_M)+\\alpha \\text{, } \\alpha \\in \\mathbb{R_{>0}}} \\sub M\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $M=\\set{E_1, E_2, E_3, E_4}$ with $w(E_1)=200$, $w(E_2)=170$, $w(E_3)=110$, $w(E_4)=98$. From here we calculate the average marketcap for an equity in $M$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{aligned}\n",
    "\\mu(w_M) &= \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{4} w(E_i) \\\\ \n",
    "&= \\frac{1}{4}(200 + 170 + 110 + 98) \\\\\n",
    "&= 144.5\n",
    "\\end{aligned}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose $\\alpha=20$, then we can pick a clear sector leader to be $L = E_1$ or $L = E_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same set of rules to choose a sector follower $F$, we can define our follower to be some equity such that,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F \\in \\set{E_f | w(E_f)<\\mu(w_M)-\\beta, \\beta \\in \\mathbb{R_{>0}}} \\sub M\n",
